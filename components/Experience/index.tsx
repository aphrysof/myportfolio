This offers the ability to compare past performance and tracking which in turn helps in achieving the companyâ€™s objective which is to enhance the member experience , improve member retention that increases the companys ROI by at least 30%. In addition to that, we are currently developing an internal dashboard that gives the companys users, especially the customer success team, an overview of product performance and GTV by partner. The dashboard also helps the IT support team investigate issues and reconcile failed payment transactions without contacting engineers from time to time. This increases productivity and communication between our internal team and partners.",
